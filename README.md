fosiliser
=========
(enlish is not my first language and i have dyslectia so plees ignor the speling erors)

an idea for some buildcraft mod
it will ad an machine caled n fosiliser i have noe moding skills butt i hope to mett some one thath can acomplich this

it will create oil for the lazy people that dont want to move araund in the minecraft world

abilitys you use organic material an to creat an organik bal

then you have to add a lot of water an use the spesial machin that tis mod adds

the machin neds an acselerated compreshion core mad whit compresors and time plates 
that ar made whit diamonds and hv cables
then you need re enforced adv aloy plates made whit 8 adv aloy plates and an iridium plate in the midle

you get abaut 100 buckets of oil in the bufer tank that you also have in the recepie

feel fre to stabilise the syntem i just think this wood be awsome
